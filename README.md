# Student Database Management with SQL

## Overview
In this two-part guided project, I built a relational student database using SQL. The project covered foundational and intermediate SQL concepts like data types, constraints, joins, and queries.

## Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL (or generic SQL)
- Relational database schema design

## Features
- Created multiple related tables (students, classes, grades)
- Used JOIN operations to extract relational data
- Practiced advanced SELECT statements and constraints

## Purpose
This project helped me:
- Learn SQL database creation and normalization
- Understand how to query and maintain structured data
- Apply constraints, relationships, and filtering logic

## Status
Completed successfully through a guided project series. Practiced writing, modifying, and querying structured data.
